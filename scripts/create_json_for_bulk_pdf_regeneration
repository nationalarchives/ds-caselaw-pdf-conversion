# Untested as an actual script, but should create a JSON file suitable for

# Send and Recieve Messages (as a Send) for the Simple Queuing Service on AWS
# (You probably want to open out.json in a text editor and copy-paste it)

# You can change the bucket name in the 'dalmatian' line below, but remember
#Â also to change the BUCKET setting in make_json.py

# takes files.txt and outputs out.json which is the finished json
